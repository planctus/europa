  In order navigate on the site in my language of preference
  As a citizen of the European Union
  I want to be able to choose my language at my first site connection

  # Regression test for a bug that broke the Portuguese (pt-pt) link.
  # See https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/NEXTEUROPA-8033
  Scenario: Test language with a custom prefix
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role
    And the "pt-pt" language is available
    When I go to "admin/config/regional/language/edit/pt-pt"
    And I fill in "edit-prefix" with "pt"
    And I press the "Save language" button
    When I go to "/"
    Then I should see the link "português"
    When I click "português"
    Then the url should match "(.*)_pt"
