Feature: Display some specific languages in lower case
  To keep in line with the languages capitalization requirements
  As an administrator user
  I want to see some languages in lower case on the languages page

  Scenario Outline: Some lowercase languages on languages pages
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
