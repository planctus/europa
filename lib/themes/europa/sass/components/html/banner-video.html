      <p>The internet and digital technologies are transforming our world. But existing
      barriers online mean citizens miss out on goods and services, internet companies and start-ups have their
      horizons limited, and businesses and governments cannot fully benefit from digital tools.</p>
      <p>It's time to make the EU's single market fit for the digital age – tearing down regulatory walls and moving
        from 28 national markets to a single one. This could contribute €415 billion per year to our economy and
        create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.</p>
